**Problem Definiton**
Investigate the landscape of political advertising on Google Ad Services with a focus on spending distribution, patterns in creatives, and seasonality trends.
We aim to:
* Identify advertisers with the highest political advertising spending and the regions in which their ads were served.
* Analyze the relationship between political ad spending and the number of creatives produced, including any trends or patterns.
* Time-series analysis to check for trends in different years and total number of impressions with time.
Our aim in this project is to unravel the intricacies of political advertising on Google Ad Services. We seek to provide valuable insights into expenditure patterns, creative production, and targeting strategies, fostering greater transparency and enabling more informed decision-making.

**Data Source**
* Transparency Report: Political Advertising on Google.
**Note:** The data for our analysis has been extracted up to November 20th 2023
